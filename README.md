# Opinion Polarization - NetLogo simulation
This is a NetLogo simulation of different social environment scenarios that can exhibit opinion polarization dynamics. 

![Alt text](img/polarized_net_sketch.jpg?raw=true "Logo")

Based on the theoretical assumptions described in the "Opinion Polarization" article, this program makes available a set of tools
to simulate the behaviour of a social network from the point of view of how connections are made and how a mediating system like
a recommendation agent can affect the formation of clusters of opinions. This framework encodes opinions as political positions. 
Because of its bipartisan characteristic, the simulated social context is the US political scenario.
